# RAG-chatbot-for-interview-prepration

the file contains diffrent itterations of chatbot most failed but chat bot.py is using lang chain ollama it works fine,
2nd itteration bot2.py is absolute beast with all thee common interview questions and knolege embeded in more structured way in kt.json file for faster retrivals and rumnning 
3rd itteration follows more systematic approch to create better UI to increase value of project with html css and js, due to failed attempt and need for better UI i swiched to Flask but tht update is still pending i dont really know frontend.

# prerequisite 
pip install ollama 
and also need to download and install ollama mistral on local machine to run this project so in it2 you need bot2.py kt.json and ollama installed also install gradio
